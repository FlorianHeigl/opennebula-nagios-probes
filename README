Nagios probes for OpenNebula-related services e.g. econe-server, occi-server
and oned RPC2.

These probes are written in Ruby and use a modified version of the nagios-probe
gem (sources available at https://github.com/hobodave/nagios-probe).

DON'T EXPECT ANYTHING USEFUL YET, THIS IS JUST AN INITIAL COMMIT WITH PROBE
TEMPLATES, DIRECTORY STRUCTURE ETC.
